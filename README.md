## Gameplay

Players maneuver the protagonist, a newborn dragon, to begin their adventure on this continent. There are six maps in total, the first five being Plains, Ocean, Volcano, Floating Islands, and Cave, where the player defeats monsters and gradually acquires a variety of abilities that will help the player explore the next area. After collecting all five abilities, players can enter the Abyss to battle the final Boss. At the end of the battle, the protagonist will reveal the mystery of his own origin, providing two endings for players to choose from, and stimulating players to think more deeply.
